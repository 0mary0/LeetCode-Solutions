    1. Two Sums:
    There were two ways to go about this question, one was to check each two numbers and their sum and compare it to the target which leads to a O(n^2),
    the other way was to use hashmap and check if each number is in the hashmap of the numbers needed to reach the target for the other members of the list which leads to O(n).
    So since the big-O for the second way is better, I decided to go with that one.
